# Scaling practices for the app :

1. Vertical scaling of app server and Database server 
    - (This can be very first approach that can be implemented inorder to handle more traffic e.g more 
    cores, RAM, etc)

2. Horizontal scaling of app 
    - (Deploying the app server on multiple servers)

3. Load balancer (NGINX) 
    - (Distibute traffic between group of app servers via load balancer)

Database master-slave replication 
    - (With read-only slaves to offload reads from master, as in our case write traffic is less as compare to reads)


Database Sharding ( Ideal for transactional scenario)

Caching - Redis Backend

Deploy App and database on same network

Database indexing for particular kind of query ( Most probably most called query )

Identify and reduce app server CPU and memory usage if continuously consuming CPU ( By Profiling)
